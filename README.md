University-Oriented Multidimensional Talent Profiling via LLMs and Diffusion Models

# University-Oriented Multidimensional Talent Profiling


##  Introduction

This project aims to explore how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Diffusion Models** can be applied to build a **dynamic and multidimensional talent profiling system**.  
The goal is to provide fairer, more comprehensive, and more personalized talent evaluations in education and research contexts.

Key directions include:
- Using **semantic embeddings** to extract essential features  
- Applying **conditional generation** for personalized talent profiles  
- Leveraging **latent diffusion** to improve stability and fluency  
- Ensuring **fairness** with adversarial optimization
