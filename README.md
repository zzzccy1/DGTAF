##  Introduction

In the rapidly evolving field of higher education, talent evaluation is crucial for fostering innovation, resource allocation, and institutional competitiveness. Traditional evaluation methods rely heavily on quantitative metrics (publications, citations, titles) but often fail to capture creativity, interdisciplinary potential, and long-term contributions.

This project is inspired by **DGTAF (Dynamic Generative Talent Assessment Framework)**, a framework that uses **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Diffusion Models** to generate **dynamic, multidimensional talent profiles**. The framework enhances evaluation by:
- Using **semantic embeddings** for feature extraction  
- Applying **conditional generation** for personalized profiles  
- Leveraging **latent diffusion** for stable and fluent output  
- Ensuring **fairness** via adversarial training
